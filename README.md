# Objective
 Create an inventory management solution that will enable an administrator at a given company to manage the entities at any of its warehouses. The administrator should possess the ability to view, add, remove, and alter any of the entities within that companyâ€™s warehouse(s). The site should provide the administrative team an easy portal to do their job so having clear and concise UI/UX is paramount. The application should also take into consideration possible edge cases such as warehouses having their own maximum capacity and handling the addition of items that would cause the warehouse to exceed its capacity.
